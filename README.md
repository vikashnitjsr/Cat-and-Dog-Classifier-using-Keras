# Cat-and-Dog-Classifier-using-Keras
In this repository I have taken a little step to build a cat vs Dog Classifier , and got the data sets from the link given here 
(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765). After downloading the data sets on local machine , what i got is 
a separate folder of Dog and Cat inside the data set ,then we need to make a data set having both (Cat and Dog images with shuffled data 
so  that we can train our model on both Cat and Dog as well, after (Shuffling the data we stored all the featured images in X.pickle and 
labeled output as Y.pickle , labeled output 0- Dog and 1-Cat .Then follow the steps:

- Download data sets from  (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)

- Make the dataset according to our model requirement as mentioned here

- Then Built a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras (Tensorflow backend ) follow this link
